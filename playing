Solution
Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Create an Executable File with the Python Interpreter Path Instruction at the Beginning
Create a file called asciiShape.py:

touch asciiShape.py
Make it executable:

chmod +x asciiShape.py
Open the file:

vim asciiShape.py
Type :set paste followed by i (for insert mode) to avoid adding unnecessary spaces and hashes when copying/pasting from the rest of the lab guide.

Insert the instruction for the Python interpreter path:

#!/usr/bin/python3
Write Two for Loops, with One Nested in the Other, to Draw a Pyramid
Press Enter twice to add a line break.

Add the following to the file:

length = 10
astr = "*"
for i in range(length):
    for j in range(length-i):
        print(" ", end='')
    print(astr)
    astr += "**"
Write a Loop to Draw an Upside-Down Pyramid of Proportional Size that Aligns with the First Pyramid
Press Enter twice to add a line break.

Add the following to the file:

length -= 1
space = 1
astrNum = ((length*2)-1)
astr = "*" * astrNum
for i in range(length):
    print(" " + space * " " + astr)
    astrNum -= 2
    astr = "*" * astrNum
    space += 1
Test It by Saving and Executing the File
Save and exit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq.

Execute the file:

./asciiShape.py
We should see a diamond shape made of asterisks.
